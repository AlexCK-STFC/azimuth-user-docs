!!! Danger
    
    Stopping or deleting machines using this page may cause potentially unrecoverable issues with platforms that they are part of.
    **Do not stop or delete machines here unless you know what you are doing!**

The machines tab allows a subset of the Instance management options available to you in the [OpenStack Web UI (Horizon)](https://openstack.stfc.ac.uk/) to be performed within Azimuth. Machines in your OpenStack Project/Tenancy can be created or managed, within your project quota. This page can also be used to easily check the status of machines deployed as part of platforms.
