!!! Warning

    Deploying JupyterHub requires an existing [Kubernetes cluster](../kubernetes.md).

### Introduction
[JupyterHub](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allows users to interact with a computing environment through a webpage. As most devices have access to a web browser, JupyterHub makes it is easy to provide and standardize the computing environment for a group of people (e.g., for a class of students or an analytics team). JupyterHub is a web-interface through which many "singleuser" Jupyter notebooks (one per user) may be launched.

The JupyterHub Kubernetes application is provided as part of the Azimuth science platforms collection. It is installed using the Applications dashboard of an Kubernetes cluster, which is powered by [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/). The Applications dashboard is available from the Services list of your Kubernetes cluster.

The Applications dashboard shows both installed Applications and a Catalog of applications available for installation. The applications in the catalog are determined by your cloud operator. To learn more about the Applications dashboard, visit the Kubeapps [documentation](https://kubeapps.dev/docs/latest/howto/dashboard/).


### Launch configuration

To get started, in the Platforms tab, press the <img class="off-glb" src="../../../assets/images/new_platform.png" style="height:1em; vertical-align:middle;"> New Platform button, and select JupyterHub.

|**Option**                                | **Explanation**|
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
|Platform name|A name to identify the JupyterHub platform|
|Kubernetes cluster|The Kubernetes platform on which to deploy JupyterHub. If one hasn't already been created, check out the [Kubernetes Overview](../kubernetes.md).|
|App version|The version of JupyterHub to use. As of writing, this is only the latest version|
|Notebook CPUs|The number of CPUs to allocate to each user notebook.|
|Notebook RAM|The amount of RAM to allocate to each user notebook.|
|Notebook storage|The amount of disk storage to allocate to each user notebook.|

### Using JupyterHub
#### Accessing JupyterHub
After creating the JupyterHub platform, it will automatically be exposed by Azimuth's Zenith proxy.

JupyterHub can be accessed via the link under Services.
![The link is under Services](../../assets/images/accessing_jupyterhub.png)

Users should be prompted to start a server, and be given three default options. 

!!! note
    Further development will allow for a custom image and/or a whole custom repo-to-docker codebase to be used

#### Profiles
![Three default profiles are available](../../assets/images/jupyter_profiles.png)

|**Profile**                                | **Description**|
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
|[Python environment (minimal)](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-minimal-notebook)|A minimally functional Jupyter server; with basic commandline tools, a TeX environment and Python (along with the Conda and Mamba package managers).|
|[Data Science Notebook](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-datascience-notebook)|Contains [popular scientific Python packages](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-scipy-notebook), [the R interpreter and a basic set of data science packages](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-r-notebook), [rpy2](https://rpy2.github.io/doc/latest/html/index.html), and the [Julia compiler along with notebook support and HDF5](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-julia-notebook).|
|[GPU-enabled Machine Learning environment](https://github.com/iot-salzburg/gpu-jupyter)|Contains GPU support and drivers; along with TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and everything in the above Data Science Notebook.|

#### Server Hub
To switch profile or restart the code server from JupyterLab, head to File â†’ Hub Control Panel.

From there, the server may be stopped and relaunched.

### Managing Users
User management can be performed via the [Identity Provider, Keycloak](../../identity_provider/identity_provider.md).
