## Cloud project
A cloud project (or cloud tenancy) is an organizational unit in the cloud to which users are assigned. Users can be members of one or more projects. 

Cloud resources belong to a *project* and not a *user*. This means that all resources within a project are visible and editable by members of the project.

## Access
To be allocated a cloud project, or to be granted access to an existing cloud project, please speak to your cloud operator.
